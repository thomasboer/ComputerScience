CS Paper LSH

This is the code belonging to the paper: Product Duplicate Detection Method with extended LSH pre-selection. Author: Thomas Boer

The code is built up as follows.
The following functions have been constructed that will later be used by a main method:

1. Data import
2. Create train data
3. Preparation for binary matrix
4. Minhashing
5. Applying LSH
6. Applying TSQS

The main method is then called.

The results are evaluated and the graphs are plotted.
